# WHAT IS IT
This is a game library object for helping to create games.
 
# WHAT DOES IT DO
It will take the canvas and resize it to the window size even if the window is resized later by the user. It will also add a black background to the canvas. It will create a canvas object from the canvas in 2D context. It can also start a game loop and keep track of FPS.
